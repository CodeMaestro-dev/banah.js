## 💡 About

**Banah JS** is a CLI tool designed to scaffold a fully functional Node.js project with just one command.  
No need to manually install and configure essential dependencies—Banah JS takes care of everything, including creating an initial project structure, a `package.json` file, and commonly used boilerplate code.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Install Banah JS globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g banah
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To create a new Node.js project, run the following command:

```bash
banah create your-project-name
```

This will:

1. Create a folder named `your-project-name`.
2. Generate a pre-configured project structure.
3. Install essential dependencies like `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, and development tools like `nodemon`.

Once the setup is complete, navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

---

## ✨ Features

- **Express.js**: A lightweight and fast web framework for server-side logic.
- **CORS**: Simplifies handling of cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: Makes managing environment variables easy and secure.
- **Nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server during development whenever you save changes.
- **Pre-configured Project Structure**: Start coding right away without worrying about boilerplate setup.
- **Readable Code**: Clean and modular project code to help beginners understand Node.js.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Start the Application

To start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Development Mode

Run the server in development mode with automatic restarts:

```bash
